“I want to build a SaaS web app like S.mple (Serhant) for real estate agents.
Please create a full Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project structure with these features:

User authentication (Supabase email + Google login)

Dashboard with sidebar (Dashboard, Projects, Brand Kit, Account)

Projects page: list projects, view project details, create new project

Project detail page: upload photos, enter property info, generate AI content, save project

Brand Kit page: upload logo, set colors, set font style

API routes for: authentication, project creation, AI content generation, image analysis (OpenAI)

Use clean Tailwind UI for layout

Add placeholder content to all pages

Include lib folder for Supabase and OpenAI helpers

Include types folder for user, project, brandKit types

Please generate the folder structure, layout.tsx, basic pages, and main components (Sidebar, Header, ProjectCard, Button, Input). Add comments in the code for a beginner.”
